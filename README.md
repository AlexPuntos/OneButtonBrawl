# OneButtonBrawl
A game where you are a streetfighter and have one one option: using your fists.

**Pitch:** You are a streetfighter picking all kinds of fights in a dingy alleyway. Gangers, drunkards, the homeless: you'll take whoever you fight on and you'll win it big. 
**The Goal:** Knock out as many opponents as you can and beat your high-score!

### Controls:
- SPACE BAR (Tap): Throw a Punch
- SPACE BAR (Hold): Block an Attack

That's it. 

### Throwing Punches
Press spacebar to throw a punch. Punching your oponent will lower their health, and eventually knock them out. 

### Blocking
Holding spacebar will block an attack the enemy throws at you, negating half of the damage from their attack. If you time your block right, you can negate all damage from the attack and stun them temporarily to land some easy blows.

### ENEMIES
Enemies will attempt to attack the player with drawn out animations that telegraph their attack. Each has a health bar. When HP reaches 0, they are knocked out and a new enemy appears. Players regain a bit of health after knocking out an enemy.
