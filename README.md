# OneButtonRevolver
A game where you have a revolver and you only have one button to use it.

Pitch: You have a revolver and are crawling through a tunnel filled robots. Walk through the tunnels, find a robot, and shoot it dead!

Controls:
- SPACE BAR (Tap): Shoot
- SPACE BAR (Hold): Take Cover and Reload

That's it. 

SHOOTING
When you are not holding space bar, you stand outside of cover and have a reticle that sways around the screen wildly. When you press space while the reticle is over an enemy, you shoot them; otherwise, you miss. Time your shots while they hover over an enemy to eliminate them!
You have only 6 rounds in your revolver. Once you exhaust your ammo, you must reload.

RELOADING
When you hold spacebar, your screen moves to the side as it puts you into cover and enemies are unable to attack you. 
You must hold the reload button for as long as it takes to reload each bullet into the cylinder.

ENEMIES
Enemies cannot shoot you while in cover.

UTILIZATION: A lot of dray raycast, simple conditionals statements, and Unity Animator to move the gun and your camera in and out of cover.
